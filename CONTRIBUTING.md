# Contributing to `React Hook Form`

As the creators and maintainers of this project, we want to ensure that `resolvers` lives and continues to grow and evolve. We would like to encourage everyone to help and support this library by contributing.

## Code contributions

Here is a quick guide to doing code contributions to the library.

1. Fork and clone the repo to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/resolvers.git`

2. Create a new branch from `master` with a meaningful name for a new feature or an issue you want to work on: `git checkout -b your-meaningful-branch-name`

3. Install packages by running:

   > pnpm

4. If you've added a code that should be tested, ensure the test suite still passes.

   > pnpm test

5. Try to write some unit tests to cover as much of your code as possible.

6. Ensure your code lints without errors.

   > pnpm lint

7. Ensure build passes.

   > pnpm build

8. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-meaningful-branch-name`

9. Submit a pull request to the upstream resolvers repository.

10. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.
